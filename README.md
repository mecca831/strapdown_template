# Description 
If you like to write documentation in Markdown, and need to present it beautifully as a single HTML file, this template is for you.

# How to use it
  + Download the template [strapdown_template.md.html],  fill-it-in with your documenting-info using markdown syntax, and save    
  + Any time latter, when you need to consult it, open it in a browser, and you will see it all colorfull and cheery :)    

# Can be improved
  + After clicking in TOC to jump to a target, the target itself gets hidden below the navbar - this is because of the navbar css rules and the TOC code...
  + It needs internet connection to download the javascript libs that it uses (would be nice to have an offline-stand-alone version)
  + With (much) more JQuery magic...  a ?mini-viewport? ... 


# Many thanks to:
  + [Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/)
  + [Jquery TOC plugin](http://projects.jga.me/toc/#toc0)
  + JQuery, Bootstrap and all other infamously renowned projects who made this possible
  + all the open source community and it's bonding attitude that grows (now more than ever) that important resource: the people's morale :)

#Description 
------------
I started using Strapdown a few months ago to make the documentation of my personal projects    
After some time using it, I made a few changes to the original Strapdown template, and built one for my self. 
And here it is, the current version of it [strapdown_template.md.html](https://github.com/zipizap/strapdown_template/raw/master/strapdown_template.md.html)     
Simply download it and fill-it-in with your documenting-info using markdown syntax.  
Then save and open it in a browser, and you will see it all colorfull and cheery :)  

It's intended to be used like a personal-notes-document:  written with text (vim+markdown) and readed in a local browser

#Can be improved
------------
  + It needs internet connection to download the javascript libs that it uses (would be nice to have an offline-stand-alone version)
  + I don't like that html-bottom of the template: its big, chunky and ugly. Maybe some day I'll have the time to make it tiny tiny like a couple lines.
  + With more JQuery magic...  a ?mini-viewport? ... 


#Many thanks to:

  + [Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/)
  + [Jquery TOC plugin](http://projects.jga.me/toc/#toc0)
  + JQuery, Bootstrap and all other infamously renowned projects who made this possible
  + all the open source community and happy people :)  (not joking!)
